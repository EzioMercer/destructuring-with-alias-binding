# Naming destructed variables

# Motivations

This proposal suggests a new syntax which will be useful shorthand for saving destructed variables in object
immediately without the need to repeat them to create a new object

In my practice, it is ubiquitous to write something like this:

```js
const foo = (config) => {
    const _config = {
        ...config,
        x: Number(config.x)
    }
    
    console.log(_config);
    /*
    Output:
    {
        ...some properties,
        x: number
    }
    */
}
```

And here is the problem for me because `config` can be an object with extra keys which I don't want to have inside the
function.
So I have to rewrite it like this:

```js
const foo = ({
    prop1,
    prop2,
    x
}) => {
    const _config = {
        prop1,
        prop2,
        x: Number(x)
    }
    
    console.log(_config);
    /*
    Output:
    {
        prop1: any,
        prop2: any,
        x: number
    }
    */
}
```

And now the problem is that I have to write the exact same things twice.
So my proposal is to let rewrite the above code in that way:

```js
const foo = ({ prop1, prop2, x } as config) => {
    const _config = {
        ...config,
        x: Number(x)
    }
    
    console.log(_config);
    /*
    Output:
    {
        prop1: any,
        prop2: any,
        x: number
    }
    */
}
```

In that way I can access the `x` explicitly writing it or get it from `config` like this `config.x` or `config['x']`

# Possible solutions without this proposal

### Rewrite with `...args`

```js
const foo = (...args) => {
    const _config = {
        ...args[0],
        x: Number(x)
    }
    
    console.log(_config);
    /*
    Output:
    {
        ...some properties,
        x: number
    }
    */
}
```

But the problem with this approach is that now I don't have control of which properties will be passed into the first
argument.
With this proposal, at least I can easily omit the unnecessary properties which can cause bugs or unexpected
results

### Rewrite arrow functions into classic functions

```js
function foo({
    prop1,
    prop2,
    x
}) {
    const _config = {
        ...arguments[0],
        x: Number(x)
    }
    
    console.log(_config);
    /*
    Output:
    {
        prop1: any,
        prop2: any,
        x: number
    }
    */
}
```

This is the closest approach because now I can access properties both individually and by the alias using `arguments`

# Features

### Granular control of the passed object

Despite the approach using the `arguments` which is great for first level aliases it is still impossible to control
second or more levels of object.
But with this proposal we can control like this:

```js
const foo = ({
    prop1,
    prop2,
    prop3: {
        prop4,
        prop5
    } as innerConfig,
    prop6: {
        prop7: {
            prop8,
            prop9
        } as innerInnerInnerConfig
    } as innerInnerConfig,
    x
} as config) => {
    const _config = {
        ...config,
        x: Number(x)
    }
    
    console.log(_config);
    /*
    {
        prop1: any,
        prop2: any,
        prop3: {
            prop4: any,
            prop5: any
        },
        prop6: {
            prop7: {
                prop8: any,
                prop9: any
            }
        },
        x: number
    }
    */
    
    console.log(innerConfig);
    /*
    {
        prop4: any,
        prop5: any
    }
    */
    
    console.log(innerInnerConfig);
    /*
    {
        prop7: {
            prop8: any,
            prop9: any
        }
    }
    */
    
    console.log(innerInnerInnerConfig);
    /*
    {
        prop8: any,
        prop9: any
    }
    */
}
```

### F# (`as` keyword)

```f#
let (var1, var2) as tuple = (1, 2)

printfn "var1: %d var2: %d tuple: %A" var1 var2 tuple // Output: var1: 1 var2: 2 tuple: 1,2
```

### Haskell (`@` symbol)

```haskell
processTuple :: (Int, Int) -> String
processTuple t@(a, b) = "First: " ++ show a ++ ", Second: " ++ show b ++ ", Original Tuple: " ++ show t

main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn $ processTuple (1, 2) -- Output: First: 1, Second: 2, Original Tuple: (1,2)
```

```haskell
data Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int } deriving Show

processPerson :: Person -> String
processPerson p@(Person n a) = "Name: " ++ n ++ ", Age: " ++ show a ++ ", Original Person: " ++ show p

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let alice = Person { name = "Alice", age = 30 }
  putStrLn $ processPerson alice -- Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30, Original Person: Person {name = "Alice", age = 30}
```

### Erlang (`=` symbol)

```erlang
process_tuple(T={A, B}) ->
    io:format("First: ~p, Second: ~p, Original Tuple: ~p~n", [A, B, T]). % Output: First: 1, Second: 2, Original Tuple: {1,2}

process_person(P=#{name := N, age := Ag}) ->
    io:format("Name: ~s, Age: ~p, Original Person: ~p~n", [N, Ag, P]). % Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30, Original Person: #{age => 30,name => "Alice"}

main(_) ->
    process_tuple({1, 2}),
    process_person(#{name => "Alice", age => 30}).
```

# Notes

I suggest `as` keyword because it is the first word which I came up with.
As we can see, other languages use different syntax for the same thing.
My suggestion doesn't require the `as` keyword as the solution.
It can be:
+ keyword: `in`, `into`, `use`, `save`, `template`, `like` etc.
+ symbol/operator: `=>`, `>>`, `->`, `<=`, `<<`, `<-`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `~`, `~>`, `<~` etc.

The keyword or symbol or operator also is not required to come after the destructing syntax
